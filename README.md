Python wrapper that simplifies the process of setting up a new Django project with sample app, templates, assets, and media configured. It provides a convenient way for developers to bootstrap their Django projects quickly, allowing them to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with initial setup tasks.

## Features
- Initialize a new Django project with a specified project name.
- Create a sample Django app within the project.
- Configure settings for static files (assets) and media files.
- Include sample HTML templates and static assets as a starting point for the project.
