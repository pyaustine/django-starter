# Django Project Starter
- The Django Project Starter is a Python wrapper that simplifies the process of setting up a new Django project with sample app, templates, assets, and media configured. It provides a convenient way for developers to bootstrap their Django projects quickly, allowing them to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with initial setup tasks.
